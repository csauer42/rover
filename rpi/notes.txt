Raspberry Pi Zero using Redbear IoT HAT
(IoT HAT uses UART pins for Bluetooth, either bypass Bluetooth or use SPI connection to AVR)

-5V power input
-UART/SPI connection to AVR
    -3V3 to 5V interface requires additional components for connection
-Pi Camera connected via camera port for access to BCM2835 H.264 hardware encoder

Application 1: h.264 streaming via socket server (off the shelf application?)
Application 2: socket server with serial read/write, passes control codes and battery voltage between
               avr and controller application (use zeroMQ)
