Raspberry Pi Zero using Redbear IoT HAT
(IoT HAT uses UART pins for Bluetooth, either disable Bluetooth and serial
 console to enable MotorControl communication)

-5V power input
-UART connection to AVR
    -3V3 to 5V level shifting handled on MotorControl board
-Pi Camera connected via camera port with v4l2 control
 (load bcm2835-v4l2 module at startup to provide /dev/video0)

start_video.sh: video setup and mpeg streaming via socket 
Intermediary:   socket server with serial read/write, passes control codes and battery voltage between
                avr and controller application (uses ZeroMQ REP-REQ socket)

Intermediary must be compiled and is dependent on ZMQ (v4.0+) and ZeroMQ C++ bindings, both available
in https://github.com/zeromq/ (libzmq and cppzmq, respectively).  The version available as a Raspbian 
package is not compatible.

systemd service files located in scripts directory, by default point to correct paths if repository is
cloned into pi user's home directory.  camera.service will configure and start video streaming on port 5001.
intermediary.service will start the Intermediary processes to pass control codes and voltage between the
AVR chip and the controller application.
